# Coffee-Delivery


<br/>
<h2>:books: Project Description</h2>
<p>In this project, I developed an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, with the following functionalities:</p>

<li>List of products (coffees) available for purchase</li>
<li>Add a specific amount of items to the cart</li>
<li>Increase or remove the amount of items in the cart</li>
<li>Form for the user to fill in his address</li>
<li>Display the total items in the cart in the Header</li>
<li>Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value</li>
<br/>
<h2>:pushpin: What did I learn?</h2>

<p>In this project, I had the opportunity to practice working with many of ReactJS features, using styled-components, contexts, reducers, immers, routing with React Router DOM, ReactHook Form and hookform/resolvers, using zod for validation. Also, I was able to work deeper with TypeScript, allowing a better organization project's files and preventing bugs.</p>

<p>I was able to establish a much more organized and efficient communication logic between the components through contexts and reducers, and I practiced organizing files in different folders, following a pre-established hierarchy, giving special importance to code refactoring to facilitate readability and maintenance.</p>

<p>In addition, I could practice using hooks like useDebounce and useMemo, as well as creating my own useLocation hook using the Geolocation API.</p>
